# CFG-Assignments

### **Hi, I'm Sarah**

üëã Welcome to my CFG Degree repository.

ü¶¥ I'm passionate about learning new skills, I was previously an Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Nurse prior to moving into an operations role within the pet insurance industry. 

üñ•Ô∏è I'm currently a Software Developer student with Code First Girls. 

**I will be using Github in this assignment to demonstrate my ability to set up github and show the need for a readme which explains the code you have written and it's uses. I will also be using this readme to demonstrate use of Github commands.**

## .gitignore

A `.gitignore` file is used in Git to specify which files and directories should be ignored in a repo. This helps prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked, ensuring that only relevant code and assets are committed. Common entries in a `.gitignore` file might include environment-specific files (`.env`) and dependency folders (`node_modules/`). This helps keep your repo clean and secure.

## requirements.txt

A `requirements.txt` file is used in Python projects to list all the dependencies and their specific versions that the project needs to run. This file allows you to easily install all the necessary packages with a single command, typically `pip install -r requirements.txt`. By sharing the `requirements.txt` file, other developers can quickly set up the same environment, ensuring consistency across different setups and reducing potential issues caused by missing or incompatible dependencies.

# CFG-Assignments

### **Hi, I'm Sarah**

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my CFG Degree repository.

I'm currently a Software Developer student with Code First Girls. Previously, I worked as an Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Nurse before transitioning into an operations role within the pet insurance industry. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new skills and excited to dive deeper into software development.

## Project Overview

This assignment showcases my ability to use Git and GitHub effectively. The repository simulates a collaborative project where I demonstrate creating branches, making commits, opening pull requests, and merging changes. By following best practices, including meaningful commit messages and proper branch management, I aim to show the importance of a well-organized repository in software development.

## Git Commands Demonstration

### Checking the Status
To check the status of the repository, use:

`git status`

### Creating a Branch
Creating a new branch allows you to work on different features without affecting the main branch:

`git branch feature-branch-name`
`git checkout feature-branch-name`

### Adding Files to a Branch
To stage files for commit, use:

`git add file-name`

![Git command to add files](/Assets/add-files.png)

### Committing Changes
After staging your changes, commit them with a meaningful message:

`git commit -m "Added a new feature to the project"`

![Git command to commit work with message](/Assets/adding-commit.png)

### Opening a Pull Request
Once your changes are committed and pushed to GitHub, open a pull request to merge them into the main branch:

`git push origin feature-branch-name`

On GitHub, navigate to the repository and open a pull request.

### Merging and Deploying to Main Branch
Once the pull request is approved, merge the changes and deploy them to the main branch:

## .gitignore

A `.gitignore` file is used in Git to specify which files and directories should be ignored in a repo. This helps prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked, ensuring that only relevant code and assets are committed. Common entries in a `.gitignore` file might include environment-specific files (`.env`) and dependency folders (`node_modules/`). This helps keep your repo clean and secure.

## requirements.txt

A `requirements.txt` file is used in Python projects to list all the dependencies and their specific versions that the project needs to run. This file allows you to easily install all the necessary packages with a single command, typically `pip install -r requirements.txt`. By sharing the `requirements.txt` file, other developers can quickly set up the same environment, ensuring consistency across different setups and reducing potential issues caused by missing or incompatible dependencies.
